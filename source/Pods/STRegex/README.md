# Regex

Pattern match like a boss.



## Usage

Create:

```swift
let greeting = Regex("hello (world|universe)")

let magic: Regex = "(.*)"
```

Match:

```swift
if greeting.matches("hello universe!") {
  print("wow, you're friendly!")
}
```

_Pattern_ match:

```swift
switch someTextFromTheInternet {
case Regex("DROP DATABASE (.+)"):
  // TODO: patch security hole
default:
  break
}
```

Capture:

```swift
let greeting: Regex = "hello (world|universe|swift)"

if let subject = greeting.match("hello swift")?.captures[0] {
  print("ohai \(subject)")
}
```

Accessing the last match:

```swift
switch text {
case Regex("hello (\\w+)"):
  if let friend = Regex.lastMatch?.captures[0] {
    print("lovely to meet you, \(friend)!")
  }
case Regex("goodbye (\\w+)"):
  if let traitor = Regex.lastMatch?.captures[0] {
    print("so sorry to see you go, \(traitor)!")
  }
default:
  break
}
```

Options:

```swift
let totallyUniqueExamples = Regex("^(hello|foo).*$", options: [.IgnoreCase, .AnchorsMatchLines])
let multilineText = "hello world\ngoodbye world\nFOOBAR\n"
let matchingLines = totallyUniqueExamples.allMatches(multilineText).map { $0.matchedString }
// ["hello world", "FOOBAR"]
```

## Development Setup

Development is currently only supported on Mac OS X. An Xcode project is
provided for your convenience.

Regex depends on Carthage for development:

```
$ brew update && brew install carthage
```

Regex uses [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to validate code style.
SwiftLint is automatically run against pull requests using [Hound CI](https://houndci.com/).

To enable SwiftLint warnings in Xcode, just make sure it's installed and available on Xcode's PATH:

```
$ brew install swiftlint
```

`xcpretty` is also recommended, for prettifying test output:

```
$ gem install xcpretty
```

After cloning the project, first set up your environment:

```
$ rake setup
```

Build and run the tests to ensure everything works:

```
$ rake
```
